# Word Embeddings in Python

The different types of word embeddings can be broadly classified into two categories-

 1. Frequency based Embedding : There are generally three types of vectors that we encounter under this category,
    * Count Vector
    * TF-IDF Vector
    * Co-Occurrence Vector
    
 2. Prediction based Embedding : Word2vec is not a single algorithm but a combination of two techniques,
    * CBOW(Continuous bag of words)
    * Skip-gram model.
