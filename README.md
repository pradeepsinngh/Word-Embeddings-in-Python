# Word Embeddings in Python

The different types of word embeddings can be broadly classified into two categories-

    Frequency based Embedding
    Prediction based Embedding
    
 There are generally three types of vectors that we encounter under this category.

    Count Vector
    TF-IDF Vector
    Co-Occurrence Vector
